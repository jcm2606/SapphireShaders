# Sapphire
Sapphire is my latest shader pack, and successor to Serenity.
Sapphire will be a realistic/atmospheric shader, employing heavy use of features such as volumetric clouds, fog, and PCSS.
Sapphire is planned to the base for Ruby, a more artsy/nostalgic shader that goes back to the roots of Minecraft shader packs.

# Sapphire Base
There will be a branch on this repo called "base".
This is the Sapphire Base, and it is a full shader base, complete with everything needed to start a new shader pack.
The Sapphire Base will be used in Ruby, and upcoming shaders.

# shaderLABs
Sapphire, like its predecessor, Serenity, will be featured on the shaderLABs network.
shaderLABs is a community and network where all the active shader devs call home.
